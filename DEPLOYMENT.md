# Deployment Guide for GitHub Repository Analysis Tool

This guide explains how to deploy the GitHub Repository Analysis Tool to make it accessible to users.

## Project Components

Our GitHub Repository Analysis Tool consists of:

1. **Streamlit Frontend** - The user interface built with Streamlit
2. **GitHub API Integration** - Direct REST API calls to GitHub
3. **Code Analysis Engine** - Pattern-based code quality analysis
4. **Visualization Components** - Interactive charts using Plotly

## Deployment Options

Based on the project requirements, we have two main deployment options:

### Option 1: Replit Deployment (Recommended)

This is the simplest option and what we're currently using:

1. Ensure your project is running correctly in Replit
2. Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
3. Your app will be available at `https://[repl-name].[username].repl.co`

**Advantages:**
- One-click deployment process
- Free tier available
- Automatic HTTPS
- Integrated with development environment

### Option 2: Hugging Face Spaces

If you want to showcase this project as an AI demo:

1. Create a Hugging Face account
2. Create a new Space with Streamlit
3. Upload the project files
4. The app will be available at `https://huggingface.co/spaces/[username]/[space-name]`

**Advantages:**
- AI community visibility
- Specialized for ML/AI projects
- Integrated with Hugging Face model ecosystem

## Setting Up GitHub Integration

To enhance the app with deeper GitHub integration:

### Basic Integration (Current Implementation)

- Uses direct GitHub REST API calls
- Rate-limited for unauthenticated users
- Supports basic repository analysis

### Advanced Integration (Future Enhancement)

1. **Create a GitHub App**:
   - Go to GitHub Developer Settings
   - Click "New GitHub App"
   - Fill in app details including callback URLs
   - Set permissions for repository access

2. **Generate Private Key**:
   - Save for authentication
   - Add as environment variable in deployment

3. **Enable OAuth Flow**:
   - Add user authentication
   - Increase API rate limits
   - Allow repository write access (for automated fixes)

## Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in your deployment:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token  # For higher API rate limits
```

## Scaling Considerations

- The current implementation uses simulated analysis instead of loading the full CodeT5 model
- For production use with the full model, consider:
  - Upgrading to a higher performance tier
  - Implementing caching for analyzed repositories
  - Adding background job processing for large repositories

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the current version using Replit's deploy feature
2. Monitor usage and performance
3. Consider implementing GitHub OAuth for higher API limits
4. Explore adding automated code fix suggestions as a premium feature
