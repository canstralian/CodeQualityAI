# Contributing to GitHub Repository Analyzer

We love your input! We want to make contributing to GitHub Repository Analyzer as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the project's coding style.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable names

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

### Bug Reports

When filing a bug report, please use the bug report template and include:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)

### Feature Requests

When suggesting a feature, please:

- Explain in detail how it would work
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome
