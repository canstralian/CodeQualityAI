  - `repo_analyzed`: Tracks if a repository has been analyzed.
  - `repo_data`: Stores information about the repository.
  - `analysis_results`: Holds the results of the code analysis.
  - `file_contents`: Contains the contents of the analyzed files.
  - `selected_tab`: Keeps track of which tab is currently selected in the UI.

```python

```python
111:         with st.spinner("Analyzing repository... This may take a few moments."):
```
- This line creates a spinner (loading indicator) that informs the user that the analysis is in progress.

```python
112:             try:
```
- This line begins a `try` block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the analysis process.

```python
113:                 logger.info(f"Starting analysis of repository: {repo_url}")
```
- This logs an informational message indicating that the analysis of the specified repository is starting.

```python
115:                 # Parse repository URL
116:                 owner, repo_name = parse_repo_url(repo_url)
```
- Line 115 is a comment indicating that the repository URL will be parsed. Line 116 calls the `parse_repo_url` function to extract the owner and repository name from the provided URL.

```python
117:                 if not owner or not repo_name:
118:                     logger.error(f"Invalid repository URL: {repo_url}")

150:                 )
```
- Lines 144-150 log a message indicating that repository files are being fetched for analysis. The `get_repository_files` method is called with parameters for the maximum number of files and the types of files to analyze.

```python
153:                 # Initialize results
154:                 analysis_results = []
155:                 file_contents = {}
```
- Lines 153-155 initialize two empty data structures: `analysis_results` (a list to store the results of the analysis) and `file_contents` (a dictionary to store the contents of the analyzed files).

```python
157:                 # Initialize code analyzer
158:                 logger.info("Initializing code analyzer")
159:                 analyzer = CodeAnalyzer()
```

```python
161:                 # Analyze each file
162:                 for i, file_info in enumerate(files):
```
- Lines 161-162 start a loop to analyze each file retrieved from the repository. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index (`i`) and the file information (`file_info`).

```python
163:                     file_path = file_info["path"]
164:                     logger.info(f"Processing file {i+1}/{len(files)}: {file_path}")
```
- Line 163 extracts the file path from the file information. Line 164 logs a message indicating which file is currently being processed, showing the index and total number of files.

```python
166:                     try:
```
- This line begins a nested `try` block to catch exceptions that may occur while processing individual files.

```python
168:                         # Skip if file is in excluded directories
169:                         excluded_dirs = [

176:                         ]
```
- Lines 168-176 define a list of directories that should be excluded from analysis, such as `node_modules`, `venv`, and others that typically contain generated or unnecessary files.

```python
177:                         if any(
178:                             excluded_dir in file_path for excluded_dir in excluded_dirs
179:                         ):
```
- Lines 177-179 check if the current file path contains any of the excluded directories. The `any` function returns `True` if at least one condition is met.

```python
180:                             logger.debug(

189:                             logger.warning(f"No content retrieved for {file_path}")
190:                             continue
```
- Lines 188-190 check if the content is empty. If it is, a warning is logged, and the loop continues to the next file.

```python
192:                         # Store file content
193:                         file_contents[file_path] = content
```

207:                         )
```
- Lines 198-207 log a message indicating that code quality analysis is being performed. The `analyze_code` method of the `analyzer` object is called with the file's content, name, extension, and selected analysis depth. The result is stored in the `result` variable.

```python
