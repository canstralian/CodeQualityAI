## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.

**How to Report a Vulnerability:**

1.  **Private Disclosure:** Please report security vulnerabilities privately by emailing us at `security@example.com`. This allows us to investigate and address the issue before it is publicly disclosed, reducing potential risks.
2.  **Detailed Information:** In your report, please provide as much detail as possible, including:
    - A clear description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    - The affected version(s) of the project.
    - Any potential impact or exploit scenarios.
3.  **Expected Response:**
    - We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
    - We will investigate the reported vulnerability and provide you with an update on our progress within 7 business days.
    - If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work to develop a patch or mitigation as quickly as possible.
    - We will notify you when a fix is available and coordinate public disclosure if necessary.
4.  **Vulnerability Acceptance/Decline:**
    - If the reported issue is confirmed as a security vulnerability, we will credit you for the discovery (if you wish) in our release notes or security advisories.
    - If the reported issue is determined not to be a security vulnerability, we will provide a detailed explanation.
5.  **Responsible Disclosure:** We ask that you allow us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before publicly disclosing it. Premature public disclosure can put other users at risk.

**Our Commitment:**

- We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly and effectively.
- We value the contributions of security researchers and appreciate your responsible disclosure.
- We strive to maintain transparency throughout the vulnerability handling process.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure.
